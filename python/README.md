# Python backend

The goal is to have Kotlin-Python interop, starting with being able to compile Kotlin to Python.

## How to try

No artifact is available yet so the only way now is to clone the repo and compile everything yourself.

## Development

All the commands should be called from the repository root.

### Compiling the compiler

```shell script
./gradlew dist
```

### Compiling `out_ir.py` from `python.kt`

```shell script
dist/kotlinc/bin/kotlinc-py -libraries dist/kotlinc/lib/kotlin-stdlib-js.jar -Xir-produce-js -output python/experiments/out_ir.py python/experiments/python.kt
```

### Generating stats about missing IR mapping

```shell script
less python/experiments/out_ir.py | grep -Po "visit[a-zA-Z0-9_]+" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > python/experiments/missing.txt
```

### Compiling `out-ir.js` from `python.kt`

To see how the same code is compiled to JS:

```shell script
dist/kotlinc/bin/kotlinc-js -libraries dist/kotlinc/lib/kotlin-stdlib-js.jar -Xir-produce-js -Xir-property-lazy-initialization -output python/experiments/out-ir.js python/experiments/python.kt
```

### Running fast tests

```shell script
./gradlew :python:ast:test  # Python AST to code tests
python/e2e-tests/run.sh  # e2e tests
```

### Running box tests

```shell script
./gradlew :python:box.tests:pythonTest
# or
./gradlew :python:box.tests:microPythonTest
```

To speed up tests:

```shell script
# create ramdisk where temporary test py files are generated extensively:
# don't forget to activate sudo before copy-pasting: sudo echo
sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=10G myramdisk python/py.translator/testData
sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=10G myramdisk1 /tmp

mount | tail -n 2  # check it's mounted successfully
sudo umount python/py.translator/testData  # unmount
sudo umount /tmp  # unmount
```

Setting `maxParallelForks` isn't required anymore since now Gradle parallelism is used.

#### Generating reports

```shell script
JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1G" python/experiments/generate-box-tests-reports.main.kts --test-task=pythonTest
# or
JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1G" python/experiments/generate-box-tests-reports.main.kts --test-task=microPythonTest
```

It will generate various reports and summaries:
* `box-tests-report.tsv` - for each test, some useful info are produced, in particular about the reason why it failed
* `failed-tests.txt` - one failed test per line. It provides much less data, but it's still useful because it gives
   a cleaner diff comparing to `box-tests-report.tsv` when something changes. E.g. when the failure reason changes,
   this file won't be affected for a given test - all that matters is that it still fails
* `failure-count.tsv` - aggregated test failure reasons
* `git-history-plot.svg` - a visual history of the number of box tests (passed VS all)

* with no Python interpreter hooked into the tests and
  * when `OK` returned from the interpreter interface: all passed
  * when something else returned from the interpreter interface: **855**/5368 passed
    (the ones that succeeded are `testAllFilesPresentIn...` tests which doesn't depend on the actual invocation of code under test)

### Before commit

Here are all the commands that update autogenerated files. Don't forget to execute them before a commit. Otherwise, the CI will fail as it executes the same commands and checks the equality of the generated files.

```shell script
./gradlew dist

dist/kotlinc/bin/kotlinc-py -libraries dist/kotlinc/lib/kotlin-stdlib-js.jar -Xir-produce-js -output python/experiments/out_ir.py python/experiments/python.kt
less python/experiments/out_ir.py | grep -Po "visit[a-zA-Z0-9_]+" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > python/experiments/missing.txt

dist/kotlinc/bin/kotlinc-js -libraries dist/kotlinc/lib/kotlin-stdlib-js.jar -Xir-produce-js -Xir-property-lazy-initialization -output python/experiments/out-ir.js python/experiments/python.kt

./gradlew :python:box.tests:pythonTest
./gradlew :python:box.tests:microPythonTest
JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1G" python/experiments/generate-box-tests-reports.main.kts --test-task=pythonTest
JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1G" python/experiments/generate-box-tests-reports.main.kts --test-task=microPythonTest
