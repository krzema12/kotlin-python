Examples of which list-related methods are supported.
--- Kotlin code ---
external fun print(value: String)  // todo: this is a temporary workaround until we support Kotlin's println

fun main() {
    val l = listOf(1, 20, 300)
    print("List size: ${l.size}")
}
--- Expected output ---
List size: 3
